### Overview:
- **VI** can be used as an alternative approach to MCMC for Bayesian Inference. It approximates the posterior distribution using an optimisation approach
- Given a family of (nice) probability distributions **D** , **VI** aims to find the member of **D**, q∗(θ) which is nearest to the exact posterior, p(θ|y). Then, q∗(θ) serves as a proxy for the exact posterior.
