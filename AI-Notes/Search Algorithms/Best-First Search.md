#UninformSearch

## Overview

- Best-first search is an instance of the general Tree-Search or Graph-Search algorithm in which a node is selected for expansion based on an evaluation function, $f(n)$. The evaluation function is Evaluation Function construed as a cost estimate, so the node with the lowest evaluation is expanded first.
- The choice of $f(n)$ determines the search strategy, its usually a $heuristic function$



### Greedy Best First Search
- Greedy best-first search is not optimal, but can be efficient.
