## Overview
- Typically an [[Open-cry]], [[Descending]] auction


## Process
- Auctioneer starts by asking for an extremely high intial price
- auctioneer repeatedly lowers the price of the good in small steps
- auction ends when someone makes a bid at the current offer price.
- price paid by winner is the price when their bid was made.

## Properties
- Suffer from similar problems to [[English Auction]].
	-  Can suffer from the **winner's curse**: has winner valued the good too highly because no one else made that high bid?
	- Can be susceptible to **collusion**.
		- bidders can agree beforehand to keep bids artificially low.
		- auctioneers can plant dummy bidders to inflate prices.
