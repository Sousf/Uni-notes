## Overview
- Typically a [[One shot]] auction.
- It is also obviously [[Sealed-bid]] (in the name).

## Process
- Each bidder makes a **single bid**
- Bid sent to auctioneer so that bidders cannot see each other's bid
- Winner is the bidder who made the highest bid
- Price paid by winner is the highest bid

## [[Dominant Strategy]] for First-price sealed bid
- **Not clear** - bid less than your true value $v_i$, but how much less depends on other agent's bids, which are unknown.

Often used for tender bids for government contracts.

## Properties
- **May not be [[Efficient]]** - since agent with highest value $v_i$ might not win the auction
- Much simpler communication than English or Dutch auctions
- Sealed bids make it harder for the type of collusion that occurred in the German spectrum auction.
