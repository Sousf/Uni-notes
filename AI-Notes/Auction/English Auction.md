## Overview
- Typically a [[First-price auctions]] and [[Open-cry]], [[Ascending]] auction.


## Process:
- Auctioneer starts by asking for a minimum (reserve) price
- auctioneer invites bids from bidders, which must be higher than the current highest price received. (perhaps require a minimum increment amount)
- Auction ends when no further bids are received, and good is sold if final bid exceeds reserve price
- price paid by the winner, winner pay the final (highest) bid.
