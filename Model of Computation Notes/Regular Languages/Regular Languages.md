Concatenation - A $\cdot$ B
Kleene Star - A*

# Closure of Regular Languages
- [[Closure of Regular Languages#Regular Languages are Closed Under Union and Intersection]]
- [[Closure of Regular Languages#Regular Languages are Closed Under Concatenation]]
- [[Closure of Regular Languages#Regular Languages are Closed Under Kleene Star]]



**Every [[Regular Languages]] are also [[Context Free Language]]**
