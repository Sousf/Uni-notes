# Pre-order
- A set R is a **pre-order** iff R is [[Properties of Relations#Transitive]] and [[Properties of Relations#Reflexive]]

# Strict Partial Order
- A set R is a **strict partial order** iff R is [[Properties of Relations#Transitive]] and [[Properties of Relations#Irreflexive]]

# Partial Order
- A set R is a partial order iff R is an **antisymmetric preorder**
- This means that to be a **partial order**, the set R must be
	- [[Properties of Relations#Transitive]]
	- [[Properties of Relations#Reflexive]]
	- [[Properties of Relations#AntiSymmetric]]


# Total Order
- A total order is a **Linear Partial Order**
- This means that to be a total order, the Set R must be
	- [[Properties of Relations#Linear]]
	- [[Properties of Relations#Transitive]]
	- [[Properties of Relations#Reflexive]]
	- [[Properties of Relations#AntiSymmetric]]
