# Reflexive
A [[Relation]] R on a set A is reflexive
- if (a,a) $\epsilon$ R for all a $\epsilon$ A

# Irreflexive
A [[Relation]] R on a set A is irreflexive
- The set R does not contain any (a,a)
- must not have any (a,a)

# Symmetric
A [[Relation]] R on a set A is symmetric
- (a,b) = (b,a)
- symmetric closure is the same in this way
	- a = b $\leftrightarrow$ b = a

# Asymmetric
A [[Relation]] R on a set A is asymmetric
- if (x,y) is not the same as (y,x) (This is the opposite of symmetric)
- (x,y) --> $\neg$(y,x)

# AntiSymmetric
A [[Relation]] R on a set A is antisymmetric
- if (a,b) $\wedge$ (b,a) --> a = b

# Transitive
A [[Relation]] R on a set A is transitive
- (x,y) $\wedge$ (y,z) --> (x,z)


# Equivalence Relation
- An equivalence [[relation]] is one that is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

# Linear 
- A set R is Linear iff inside R, **(x,y) $\vee$ (y,x) = y**
