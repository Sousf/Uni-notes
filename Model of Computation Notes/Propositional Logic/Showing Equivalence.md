# For both [[Propositional Logic]] and [[Predicate Logic]]

### To show F $\equiv$ G, we can show:
1) ¬(F⇔G) is unsatisfiable via [[resolution]], since¬(F⇔G) is unsatisfiable iffF≡G
2) Draw out truth table and compare
3) Convert one formula to the other
### To Refute F $\equiv$ G, we can show:
1) Refute F≡G (show they are not logically equivalent), by exhibiting a truth assignment which makes one true and the other false. For example,A⇒B $\wedge$ B⇒A ***does not hold***
